Notice that 'abstract_idea' here can also include composite ideas, i.e. sets of connections or one single connection used as a node in an argument. By doing so we can support, for example, Dung's abstract argumentation framework."^^xsd:string ;

:connection
    a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment "A connection of two abstract_ideas through a relation. Since a connection is itself an abstract_ideas, the connection can also link two connections, or one connection with a node (= a simple idea) . in other words, a connection can be used as a node in a new connection. At the moment, we only provide support for representing binary connections only (two nodes only). Moreover, when a connection is instantiated, it is also possible to define the node_types of the two ideas which are connected. The node_types are also called the 'roles' or 'contexts' of the ideas."^^xsd:string ;

:connection_label

    a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment "The roles (or types) used for organizing the labels between ideas: e.g. supports, contrasts, is-example-of etc... It is important to remember that its subclasses must be disjoint - this is one of the reasons why we decided to use OWL, as RDFS would not let us specify this feature."^^xsd:string ;

:connection_node_role

For example, it can be an 'answer', a 'conclusion', an 'idea', an 'experiment' etc. Cohere suggests some predefined roles, but users can also create new roles for their ideas."^^xsd:string ;
